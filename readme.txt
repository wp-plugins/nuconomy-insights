Go beyond traditional metrics like the page view and instead measure engagement.
== Description ==

Get amazing insights about how readers use your blog, what they like, why they like it and what should you be writing about. 
Activities, not just page views. We measure all of the rich interactions (e.g. Ajax, Flash) that take place, in addition to the more simplistic, traditional measures like page views, bounce rate, etc.

User level. We track activities at the user level, using registration data or blogger nicknames, if they exist, or by creating anonymous accounts if no registration data exists.

Deep, actionable behavioral insights. Insights into what causes users to do certain activities (e.g. post, comment, share, trackback, etc.). Everything is exposed via a two-way API, allowing the insights to be acted upon immediately vs. just being included in a report. 
Our API implements four ways: JavaScript; ActionScript; Silverlight; and Server side (REST/SOAP).

Optimization. At the highest level, our goal is to optimize users' digital experience.  You can input your blogging goals (e.g. increase comments, increase shares, etc.) and our system tells you how to optimize your digital assets to achieve this goal. Through the API, the system can auto-correct and dynamically ‘learn’ to continue optimization. The
powerful 1:1 marketing and programming that we have often aspired to is now possible.

Easy to implement. Implementation takes a few seconds.  See below.
